An epic adventure through Python

The woodland hermit
===================

Once there was a forest. An ancient, overgrown, full of shadows with 
occasional beams of lights piercing through the tall tree canopy (mostly oaks) 
sort of forest.

...

X prepared his writing desk. He took his quill out, dipped it in the ink and 
started writing.

    print('The land is in dire peril.')

I wonder what did he mean by that? It might seem a bit peculiar that one would 
go enclosing his sentences in quotation marks and then squeezing them inside 
parentheses explaining (?) a `print` message, but what was much stranger by 
far was the fact that in the next line ink started appearing by itself!

 > The land is in dire peril.

This is where you could really see that there is something special 
about this character. What makes him so special (aside his somewhat 
unorthodox appearance) is his mastery of *Python*. You can think of Python 
as spellcraft -- it enables you to conjure up things that didn't exist 
before. X told it to print his sinister insinuation and Python (incarnated 
in X's parchment and ink) did exactly that. An instruction and the effect. That is the essence of Python.

But why didn't X simply jot his own message on his own in the first place? 
Yes, in this case he could have done that. But since the land is indeed in 
**real peril** and X wants to make you fully comprehend it he writes down

    print('The land is in dire peril. ' * 5)

and the parchment was swiftly filled with

 > The land is in dire peril. The land is in dire peril. The land is in dire peril. The land is in dire peril. The land is in dire peril. 

That saved X some writing, hasn't it?
