An epic adventure through Python

The woodland hermit
===================

Once there was a forest. An ancient, overgrown, full of shadows with 
occasional beams of lights piercing through the tall tree canopy (mostly oaks) 
sort of forest.

...

X prepared his writing desk. He took his quill out, dipped it in the ink and 
started writing.

    print('The land is in dire peril.')

I wonder what did he mean by that? It might seem a bit peculiar that one would 
go enclosing his sentences in quotation marks and then squeezing them inside 
parentheses explaining (?) a `print` message, but what was much stranger by 
far was the fact that in the next line ink started appearing by itself!

 > The land is in dire peril.

This is where you could really see that there was something special 
about this fellow. What made him so special (aside his somewhat 
unorthodox appearance) was his mastery of *Python*. You can think of Python 
as sorcery -- it enables you to conjure up things that didn't exist 
before. X told it to print his sinister insinuation and Python (incarnated 
in X's parchment and ink) did exactly that. An instruction and the effect. That is the essence of Python.

But why didn't X simply jot his own message in the first place without 
all the `print('')` gibberish? Yes, in this case it would have been 
shorter to do just that. But since the land is indeed in 
**dire peril** and X wanted you to fully comprehend the direness of the 
situation, he wrote down

    print('The land is in dire peril. ' * 5)

and the parchment was swiftly filled with

 > The land is in dire peril. The land is in dire peril. The land is in dire peril. The land is in dire peril. The land is in dire peril. 

That saved X some writing, didn't it?
